# Emergency-Ventilator-Durbar-Kandari
Emergency Ventilator for coping high demand
# Introduction
Critical patients with corona disease have severe coughing, shortness of breath and sore throat, in most cases they cannot breathe on their own. Then they need artificial respiration through a ventilator. The ventilator works to carry oxygen and emit carbon dioxide to the patient's lungs.
But the number of ventilators in Bangladesh is less than required. Durbar Kandari Emergency Ventilator has been created to solve the problem of this ventilator crisis in the country.
Durbar Kandari Emergency Ventilator which is made with very low cost indigenous technology and which is also very easy and safe to operate. This ventilator has been redesigned following the model of Emergency-Ventilator developed by the world renowned MIT in Corona.
# Ventilator Features
# 1. Mode
Our ventilator basically supports volume control mode. It presses an ambu bag with the help of two mechanical arms connected by a rack and pinion. Also with the help of pressure sensor can understand the value of pressure and the value of volume from the displacement of the rack and can implement the modes accordingly.

Currently it is possible to implement two modes in our ventilator. These are Assist Control Mode (AC) and Manual Mode.
# AC Mode: 
In this mode our ventilator user has to set the values ​​of Tidal Volume, Frequency, FiO2 and PEEP. The ventilator will then provide the patient with a certain volume of oxygen-rich air at a specific frequency. In this case, if the patient tries to breathe, the complete Breath Cycle will be completed. ACV is unsuitable for patients who breathe fast.
# Manual Mode: 
In this mode our ventilator user has to set the values ​​of Tidal Volume, Frequency, I / E Ratio, FiO2, PEEP, Peak Pressure. In this mode the ventilator will supply oxygen rich air of a certain volume to the patient according to a specific I / E ratio. In this case the complete Breath Cycle will be completed at a specific frequency.
# 2. Alarm
Our ventilator has a variety of alarms to ensure patient safety. Alarms - Exceeded PIP Pressure, Under Pressure, Tube leak, Unmet Tidal Volume, Over Current Fault and Mechanical Fault Alarm.

It is important to note that each alarm will display a defect on the display.
If the patient's inspiratory pressure is ever higher than the prescribed peak inspiratory pressure, the ventilator will automatically stop pressing the ambo bag and alert the person on duty via an Exceeded PIP Pressure alarm.

If for any reason the Breathing Circuit is disconnected, it will alert the person concerned through Tube Leak Alarm.

Similarly, if the value of inspiratory pressure is comparatively low due to any leakage or any other reason, the ventilator will notify the person on duty through Under Pressure alarm.
Unmet Tidal Volume alarm will alert the user if our device provides less Tidal Volume than the required Tidal Volume of the patient.
# 3. Android App
By activating the Bluetooth of the mobile phone and launching the app created for the ventilator, the user's mobile connection with the ventilator will be established and the user will be able to control the device through his mobile.By going to the mobile app, the user can set the value of BPM, Tidal Volume, PEEP etc. as per his requirement.When the value is set the device will send a confirmation message to the user and the device will start working as per instructions as soon as the device presses the “1” button and “start” button. Through the app of the phone, the user can also see the graph of the patient's pressure flow.
If the device exceeds a certain limit of current, it will alert the user via Over Current Fault Alarm.
Mechanical Fault Alarm will alert the person concerned when mechanical fault occurs.
